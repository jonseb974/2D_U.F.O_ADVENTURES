## INTRODUCTION
This project is a 2D GUI video game design with some of the main technology I have studied at Holberton School Laval.
This game will be especially designed to match the purpose of my Holberton school final portfolio project.
It will involve a main character, in an adventure quite simple and designed to show some of the knowledge I have learned in the context of [a space invader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) like shooting game.
